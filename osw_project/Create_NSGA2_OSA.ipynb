    "**Create an OpenStudio Analysis JSON (OSA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is taken from: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19401493.2020.1778788\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenStudio Analysis Framework (OSAF) was developed with the intention of putting advanced energy modelling capabilities in the hands of industry practitioners. To do this, OSAF uses analysis workflows that are shareable, transportable, and reproducible by using a standardized OSA problem definition JSON file, and supporting files that can be easily compressed and used on different computing environments. The OSA contains information on the algorithm and its parameters, variables with their uncertainty descriptions (e.g. the minimum and maximum allowed values, normally or uniformly distributed), output variables, and objective functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these workflows, individual models are no longer the basis from which the analysis is derived. Instead, the paradigm involves a ‘seed’, which is the baseline model around which the analysis is built, and a chain of scripts, which are run by the Workflow Gem and are used to programmatically implement changes to the baseline model. The scripts, called Measures (Roth, Goldwasser, and Parker 2016; Brackney et al. 2018; Roth et al. 2018), can be generic and reusable across different models and analyses. The chain of scripts and their arguments, as well as the definition of the variables, is described in the ‘workflow’ section of the OSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Measure-based workflow can be described abstractly as a black box mathematical function  \n",
    "\n",
    "    y=F(x)        equation (1)    \n",
    "\n",
    "where x is a vector of independent variables or inputs, y is a vector of output variables, and the function F is the application of Measures on the seed model followed by the simulation of the building energy model and any reporting Measures that are part of the workflow and used to compute the output variables. Formulating the problem in this way enables the application and switching between the algorithms that operate on the entire BEM based workflow, since the algorithms are designed to operate on processes which can be defined by equation (1). In this context, an independent variable x is simply a Measure input argument that is no longer fixed to a specific value, but one that has an allowed range of values and an uncertainty distribution type. To compute the outputs y, the selected algorithm creates a set of specific x variable values (based on the problem type and variable uncertainty descriptions) along with the information in the workflow section, and eventually gets transformed to a set of specific OSWs, which are then simulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image description](OSA.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline model changes can be varied manually by the user or automatically by an algorithm. Although manually configured analyses are limited by nature in the number of design alternatives they contain, algorithmic analyses can have a much larger number of design alternatives. The use of the same simulation workflow is key to enabling different algorithmic types of analyses (i.e. change from full factorial to sensitivity analysis to uncertainty quantification to optimization to calibration).\n",
    "\n",
    "This example will create an OSA that can generate a similiar Pareto Front graphic like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image description](heating_cooling_pareto.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "OSAs can be created using the GUI OpenStudio Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT) or programatically using the OpenStudio-Analysis gem, which is the focus of this notebook.\n",
    "To start, load the openstudio-analysis gem.  The features described here require Version >= 1.3.0-0"
