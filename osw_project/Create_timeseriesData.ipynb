    "**Create a Baseline Model and OpenStudio Workflow (OSW)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenStudio SDK is a software development kit for building, simulating, and analyzing building performance. It provides a platform for modeling energy use, thermal comfort, indoor air quality, and other aspects of building performance. The OpenStudio Workflow (OSW) is a way to programmatically make changes to an OpenStudio Model using Measures. Measures are pre-packaged scripts that make specific changes to the model, such as adding windows, changing the orientation of the building, or changing the construction of walls.  They can be sourced from the OpenStudio Building Component Library or from the measure gems. The OSW provides a way to automate a series of Measures in a sequential manner, creating a repeatable and scalable method for modeling building performance. The OpenStudio Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to run the Model using a command line interface, providing a powerful tool for automating workflows, large scale simulations, and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, load the 'openstudio' Ruby bindings to the SDK as well as 'fileutils' for basic file/directory manipulation."
